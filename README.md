#Pynance - an API for Google Finance

[Google Finance](http://finance.google.com/) is pretty nifty. It lets you record stock transactions,
whether or not you actually made them, and see the outcome. It also has an [API](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/reference.html),
although it is technically deprecated.

I was looking for a good place to test out computerized trading algorithms, but didn't want to bother with
simulating an entire stock market. Pynance does one better: it allows you to make 'trades' on the 'real'
stock market and see the results. That's pretty sweet, eh?

I've just sort of been hacking on this on my own for the past five hours. Nothing is well organized,
nor is it well commented, but it *sort of* works. You can see, create, and delete new portfolios.
You can see the stocks in your portfolios. You cannot do anything else.

Soon, my friend. ***Soon***. Have patience.
